=== 0.7.7/11-17-2009
* 5 Major Enhancements:
  * Got rid of the hacky RuLexer ancestor class. woo-hoo!

  * Build scripts completely rewritten; hoe is now gone!

    * but such expressions are always ended by ::
    * even if inside a implicit parens context
    * and positions of whitespace tokens in module header are better tracked
  * Finally learned to disable rdoc for files it dislikes (thanks, Roger!)
  * Rescue in rhs context is always ternary now
    * (this is incorrect if in a multiassign, but redparse will handle that)

=== 0.7.3/4-19-2009
* 9 Bugfixes:
  * remember whether comma was seen in paren context
  * reducing the warning load

  * break/next/return method after . was not detected properly
  * need a NoWsToken before :: in names of compound modules

  * all files should be world-readable now

* 9 Minor Enhancements:
  * move test data into lib/ dir so I can get to it better from redparse
  * split parse_keywords into separate methods for each keyword
  * (I had hoped to speed up keywords, but keyword_def is still slow)

  * yet more hacks in aid of string inclusions
  * backslashes in strings are no longer interpreted automatically when lexed
  * here documents are completely rewritten in a tricky way that more closely mimics what MRI does
  * many more flags for tokens to tell apart the various cases:
    * the various different local variable types have to be detected.
    * colons which operate like semicolons or thens are marked as such
    * { } used in block now flagged as parsing like do and end
    * commas now are marked with different types depending on how they're used
    * @variables in methods need to be marked as such, so their parsetree can come out different.
    * clearly mark backquoted strings

    * when ws between method name and parenthesis
    * break/return/next
    * ? : << / rescue do

* 5 Minor Enhancements
  * colon or star in assignment make it a multi assignment
  * presence of unary * or & in param list forces it to be a multi-param list

  * ~ is overridable, however :: is not
  * raise is not a keyword
  * in addition to 0x00, 0x04 and 0x1a should be considered eof in ruby. why? idunno.

  * most of the offset problem I had been seeing have been fixed, tho
